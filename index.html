            <h1 style="text-align:center;">Our story</h1>
            <p>While serving as a Family Readiness Group Assistant and Manager during my husband’s 21 years of active duty service to our nation and four combat deployments to Iraq, I was able to learn the sacrifice and commitment that people share on a day-to-day basis. Everyone has a story filled with great moments and some not so great moments. Most dream of having their own home or having that new car but because of their not so great moments may have had some blemishes with respect to their credit.    During our early years in the military our budget was tight and our credit was not so great. It was during this time that I educated myself and reached out to several organization to assist and educate me on what I needed to do to fix our financial situation. It was then that I started the process of understanding what it takes to get on the right track. I also helped out numerous spouses repair their credit so that their husband’s return and sacrifice was not in vain. It is that same commitment that my husband had to the Nation and I had to the husbands and wives of our Veterans along with the lessons learned that got me started on Credit Repair Services. That same commitment and service we shared while in the military is what we bring to this company.
            Being able to have good credit is not a privilege, it is right that we all have and Fresh-Beginning –National is committed to helping our clients attain that right. We will not mislead our clients or aggressively pursue and/or persuade them to join our program if it is not needed. We take pride in helping people reach their credit goals and aiding them in fulfilling their dreams of getting that house or car that they have always wanted. We take pride in what we do, we are here for the long haul and our commitment is consistent.</p>
